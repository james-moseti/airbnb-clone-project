- **Query Optimization**: Efficient database queries and prefetching

## üîß Feature Breakdown

### **User Management**

Implements secure user registration, authentication, and profile management for both guests and hosts. Users can create accounts, verify their identity, and maintain detailed profiles with preferences and booking history. This foundation enables personalized experiences and trust-building between platform participants.

### **Property Management**

Allows hosts to create, update, and manage their property listings with detailed descriptions, pricing, and availability. Properties include comprehensive information such as location, amenities, photos, and house rules. This feature serves as the core inventory system that drives the entire rental marketplace.

### **Booking System**

Enables guests to search, reserve, and manage property bookings with flexible date selection and guest capacity options. The system handles booking confirmations, modifications, and cancellations while preventing double-bookings. This critical feature facilitates the core transaction between guests and hosts.

### **Payment Processing**

Integrates secure payment handling for booking transactions, including payment capture, processing, and refund management. Supports multiple payment methods and maintains detailed transaction records for financial tracking. This feature ensures safe and reliable monetary exchanges between users.

### **Review System**

Allows guests to leave ratings and detailed reviews for properties and hosts after completed stays. Features multi-dimensional ratings for cleanliness, accuracy, location, and overall experience. This system builds trust and helps future guests make informed booking decisions.

### **Search & Discovery**

Provides advanced property search functionality with filters for location, dates, price range, amenities, and property type. Includes map-based browsing and intelligent recommendations based on user preferences. This feature helps guests efficiently find properties that match their specific needs.

Our AirBnB Clone uses a relational database design optimized for a rental platform. The database structure supports complex relationships between users, properties, bookings, and transactions while maintaining data integrity and performance.

## üîê API Security

### **Authentication & Authorization**

Implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access control to ensure only verified users can access protected endpoints. Token-based authentication provides stateless security while authorization controls prevent unauthorized access to sensitive operations. This protects user accounts from takeover and ensures guests cannot modify host-only resources like property listings.

### **Data Protection & Encryption**

All sensitive data including passwords, payment information, and personal details are encrypted both in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest. API responses sanitize sensitive information and implement field-level permissions. This safeguards user privacy, prevents data breaches, and ensures compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR.

### **Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection**

Implements API rate limiting to prevent abuse, brute force attacks, and system overload from excessive requests. Different endpoints have tailored limits based on their sensitivity and resource requirements. This maintains system availability, prevents automated attacks on authentication endpoints, and ensures fair resource usage across all users.

### **Input Validation & SQL Injection Prevention**

All API inputs undergo strict validation and sanitization using Django's built-in security features and custom validators. Parameterized queries and ORM usage prevent SQL injection attacks. This protects against malicious data manipulation, prevents database corruption, and ensures data integrity across all user interactions.

### **Payment Security (PCI Compliance)**

Payment processing integrates with secure third-party providers and never stores sensitive card data directly. Implements tokenization and follows PCI DSS standards for handling financial transactions. This protects users' financial information, prevents payment fraud, and maintains trust in the platform's monetary transactions.

### **Session Management & CSRF Protection**

Secure session handling with automatic timeout, secure cookie flags, and CSRF tokens for state-changing operations. Sessions are invalidated on suspicious activity and logout. This prevents session hijacking, unauthorized actions through malicious websites, and maintains user account security across browsing sessions.

### **Security Monitoring & Logging**

Comprehensive logging of security events, failed authentication attempts, and suspicious activities with real-time monitoring. Automated alerts for potential security breaches and audit trails for compliance. This enables rapid incident response, helps identify attack patterns, and provides forensic capabilities for security investigations.
